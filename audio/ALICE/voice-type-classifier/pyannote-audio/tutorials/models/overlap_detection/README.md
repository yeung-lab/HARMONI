# End-to-end overlapped speech detection with `pyannote.audio`

This tutorial assumes that you have already followed the [data preparation](../../data_preparation) tutorial, and teaches how to train, validate, and apply an overlapped speech detection neural network on the [AMI](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus) dataset using `pyannote-audio` command line tool. In particular, this should reproduce the result reported in second line of Table 3 of [this introductory paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01255).

## Configuration
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

To ensure reproducibility, `pyannote-audio` relies on a configuration file defining the experimental setup:

```bash
$ export EXP_DIR=tutorials/models/overlap_detection
$ cat ${EXP_DIR}/config.yml
```
```yaml
# An overlapped speech detection model is trained.
# Here, training relies on 2s-long audio chunks,
# batches of 64 audio chunks, and saves model to
# disk every one (1) day worth of audio.
task:
   name: OverlapDetection
   params:
      duration: 2.0
      batch_size: 64
      per_epoch: 1

# Data augmentation is applied during training.
# Here, it consists in additive noise from the
# MUSAN database, with random signal-to-noise
# ratio between 5 and 20 dB
data_augmentation:
   name: AddNoise
   params:
      snr_min: 5
      snr_max: 20
      collection: MUSAN.Collection.BackgroundNoise

# Since we are training an end-to-end model, the
# feature extraction step simply returns the raw
# waveform.
feature_extraction:
   name: RawAudio
   params:
      sample_rate: 16000

# We use the PyanNet architecture in Figure 2 of
# pyannote.audio introductory paper. More details
# about the architecture and its parameters can be
# found directly in PyanNet docstring.
architecture:
   name: pyannote.audio.models.PyanNet
   params:
      rnn:
         unit: LSTM
         hidden_size: 128
         num_layers: 2
         bidirectional: True
      ff:
         hidden_size: [128, 128]

# We use a constant learning rate of 1e-2
scheduler:
   name: ConstantScheduler
   params:
      learning_rate: 0.01
```

## Training
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

The following command will train the network using the training subset of AMI database for 1000 epochs:

```bash
$ pyannote-audio ovl train --subset=train --to=1000 --parallel=4 ${EXP_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
```

This will create a bunch of files in `TRN_DIR` (defined below). One can also follow along the training process using [tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard):
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir=${EXP_DIR}
```

## Validation
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

To get a quick idea of how the network is doing on the development set, one can use the `validate` mode.

```bash
$ export TRN_DIR=${EXP_DIR}/train/AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.train
$ pyannote-audio ovl validate --subset=develop --from=200 --to=1000 --every=100 ${TRN_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
```
It can be run while the model is still training and evaluates the model every 100 epochs. This will create a bunch of files in `VAL_DIR` (defined below). 

In practice, it is tuning a simple overlapped speech detection pipeline and stores the best hyper-parameter configuration on disk (i.e. the one that maximizes detection f-score):

```bash
$ export VAL_DIR = ${TRN_DIR}/validate/AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.development
$ cat ${VAL_DIR}/params.yml
```
```yaml
detection_fscore: 0.7778446845594343
epoch: 800
params:
  min_duration_off: 0.1
  min_duration_on: 0.1
  offset: 0.4685761398070873
  onset: 0.4685761398070873
  pad_offset: 0.0
  pad_onset: 0.0
```

See `pyannote.audio.pipeline.overlap_detection.OverlapDetection ` for details on the role of each parameter.

## Application
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

Now that we know how the model is doing, we can apply it on test files of the AMI database: 

```bash
$ pyannote-audio ovl apply --subset=test ${VAL_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset 
```

Raw model output and overlapped speech detection results will be dumped into the following directory: `${VAL_DIR}/apply/{BEST_EPOCH}`.

## More options

For more options, see:

```bash
$ pyannote-audio --help
```

That's all folks!
