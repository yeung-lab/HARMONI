# `pyannote-audio` | neural building blocks for speaker diarization

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pyannote/pyannote-audio/blob/develop/notebooks/introduction_to_pyannote_audio_speaker_diarization_toolkit.ipynb)

`pyannote.audio` is an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization. Based on [PyTorch](pytorch.org) machine learning framework, it provides a set of trainable end-to-end neural building blocks that can be combined and jointly optimized to build speaker diarization pipelines:

`pyannote.audio` also comes with [pretrained models](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio-hub) covering a wide range of domains for voice activity detection, speaker change detection, overlapped speech detection, and speaker embedding:

## Installation

`pyannote.audio` only supports Python 3.7 (or later) on Linux and macOS. It might work on Windows but there is no garantee that it does, nor any plan to add official support for Windows.

The instructions below assume that `pytorch` has been installed using the instructions from https://pytorch.org.

Until a proper release of `pyannote.audio` is available on `PyPI`, it must be installed from source using the develop branch of the official repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio.git
$ cd pyannote-audio
$ git checkout develop
$ pip install .
```

## Documentation

Part of the API is described in [this](tutorials/pretrained/model) tutorial.  

Documentation is a work in progress and is scheduled to be ready by end of April 2020.
